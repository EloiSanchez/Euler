"""
In this version we store all the previous chains in a dictionary named d
and check if our result is in there. If it is, we just add the current chain
to the already calculated.

The improvement relies on
- Ability to store a dictionary of such dimension (maybe add a length 
restriction)
- If finding a number inside the dictionary is faster than calculating the 
chain
